# SplitBill

***

## A brief summary

SplitBill is an app that make splitting the bill at a restaurant less of 
a pain. It shows everything you ordered and what your contribution to 
the tip is.

That's -- that's about it.

## Features

* Choose from 10 South African restaurants where you wanna eat. More 
coming soon.
* You can share the bill when you're done eating, for whatever reason 
you may want to do that.
* You can add things to the bill that I may have accidentally left out 
of the restaurant menus.

## Changelog

### 1.0

Initial Release.

### 1.0.1

Fixed a little issue on Android Marshmallow where the app would crash if 
you hit the software back button at the bill screen.

### 1.1

There was no 1.1. I'm as bad at counting as Microsoft and Apple are.

### 1.2

Added the Amy button, named after my good friend Amy. It lets you add 
things that I forgot to include in the menus to your bill.

## Roadmap

There's a lot I still want to do. Here's the roadmap I've been looking 
at since I finished 1.0:

* ~~Add your own item button~~
* ~~A settings screen~~
* Ability to search menus
* A remote database instead of a local one
* You tell me I guess

## How to build

Do a `git pull`, import it into Android Studio and build it like you 
would any other Android app.
