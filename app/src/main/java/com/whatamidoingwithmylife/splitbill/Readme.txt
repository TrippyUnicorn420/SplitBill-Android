Welcome to the SplitBill source code!

The main package of the app is comprised of the repo, activities and ViewModels. Every one of
the classes has an explanation explaining why it exists.

I highly recommend reading all of the readmes inside the packages before going and printing
everything, if you plan on doing so. They aren't very long, I promise.
