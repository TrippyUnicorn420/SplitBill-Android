This package has things that I used to use, that now have no purpose. Because I wanted to show
that there were multiple stages to the coming of this app, I dumped all those old files that now
have no purpose inside this package. :)

Some files are completely commented out because they threw compile-time errors. Since I didn't want
to spend time fixing things I'd never use again (except maybe for reference), I commented them out
completely. Android Studio is chill af and didn't require me to make a class, enum or interface
in those files, so everybody wins at the end of the day. :)
